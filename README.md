Organization
------------
The project leader will break deadlocks if the group cannot agree on something. We are rotating team leaders for each part of the project. Brian was the group leader for Part 1 and Shawn is the group leader for Part 2.

The group will divide the classes/features between the members for each project. Team members can collaborate on any class/feature if desired. Each member will create a branch off of development to work on their classes/features. When they are done, a pull request will be made for the other members to review their code before it is merged back into development. The group will work together on creating the release branch to get the project ready to turn in.

Work Procedures
---------------
We are using the [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) design to pattern how we create our branches.  
Files will be encoded in UTF-8 and Windows line endings will be used.
