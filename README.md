Organization
------------
The project leader will break deadlocks if the group cannot agree on something.   
We will rotate group leaders for every project. Brian is the first group leader.

The group will divide the classes/features between the members for each project. Team members can collaborate on any class/feature if desired. Each member will create a branch off of development to work on their classes/features. When they are done they will create a pull request for the other members to review their code before it is merged back into development. The group will work together on creating the release branch to get the project ready to turn in.

Work Procedures
---------------
For future projects, will use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) design to pattern how we create our branches.  
Files will be encoded in UTF-8 and Windows line endings will be used.
