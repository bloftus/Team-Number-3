To Do List For Part 2
=====================

1. Create at least stub methods/classes for all the functionality.
2. Use a List to at least make the file names part of your API functional. (The ability to add and remove files from the index?)
3. Have functionality for the app to check if any files have been changed/deleted on start up.
4. Maybe not required for right now but another classmate mentioned that in his example the search button is disabled until you actually enter test.
