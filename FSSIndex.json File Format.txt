File Search System
Version 1.0

The file FSSIndex.json is located in your "user.home" directory and contains 
all of the information for the indexed files. It is created from JSONObjects 
and JSONArrays from the json-simple-1.1.jar package. It is encoded in UTF-8
and has Windows line endings.

Each file indexed has id, path, and modified values. The id is the unique 
identifier for each file, the path is the absolute path for each file, and 
modified is a long value that represents the time that a file was last modified. 

Each word indexed has at least one location in one file. Words can be present in 
multiple places in multiple files. The file that a word is located in is 
identified by its unique identifier. Unique identifiers and word positions both
start at zero.

An example of what the index could look like:
{
    "name": "File Search System",
    "version": "0.1",
    "indexedFiles": 3,
    "data":
        {
            "files":
                [
                    { "id": 0, "path": "C:\Temp\a.txt", "modified": 1520012345678 },
                    { "id": 1, "path": "C:\Temp\b.txt", "modified": 1520020034433 },
                    { "id": 2, "path": "C:\Temp\hello.txt", "modified": 1520039999999 }
                ],
            "words":
                [
                    { 
                        "word": "apple", 
                        "location": 
                            [
                                { "file": 0, "location": [0, 3, 4, 52, 113] },
                                { "file": 1, "location": [3, 5, 92] }
                            ]
                    },
                    { 
                        "word": "orange", 
                        "location": 
                            [
                                { "file": 1, "location": [7, 9] },
                                { "file": 2, "location": [1, 12, 20] }
                            ]
                    }
                ]
        }
}
